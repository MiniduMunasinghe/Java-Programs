This program showcases the use of Java generics to create a reusable and type-safe calculation system. It includes the following features:

Generic Class TCalculation:

Restricts the type parameter to numeric types (Integer, Double, etc.) using T extends Number.
Supports appending values dynamically and calculates their average.
Demo Implementation:

Demonstrates the functionality with both Integer and Double types.
Outputs the calculated average for each type.
Key Concepts:
Generics (<T> with bounded types).
Collections (ArrayList for dynamic storage).
Numeric calculations with Number and its subclasses.
