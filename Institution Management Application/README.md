The Institution Management Application is a Java-based program designed to simulate the management of an educational institution, focusing on courses, students, and teachers. The application uses object-oriented principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation to model real-world relationships between these entities. Courses are represented as abstract objects with attributes like code and name, while students and teachers are modeled as individuals who can enroll in or teach courses, respectively. The program allows for dynamic linking of students to courses and teachers to courses, ensuring a flexible and extensible structure. It provides methods to display detailed information about each student and teacher, including the courses they are associated with, offering a clear and organized view of institutional operations.
