The Library Manager is a Java-based console application designed to manage a collection of book titles. Users can add book titles to a collection, remove a specific title, and view the remaining titles in lexicographical order. The program uses a PriorityQueue to efficiently organize and manage the book titles. After entering all the book titles, users can specify a title to remove, and the program will confirm whether the removal was successful. Finally, it displays the total number of books left in the collection and prints the remaining titles in order.
