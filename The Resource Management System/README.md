The Resource Management System is a Java-based multithreaded application that demonstrates resource allocation and management using concurrency controls. The program simulates multiple users (threads) requesting access to a limited number of shared resources. Using java.util.concurrent.locks and the ReentrantLock mechanism, the system ensures that resources are allocated fairly and efficiently while preventing race conditions. Each user thread acquires a resource, performs operations, and releases it for others to use, with appropriate thread-safe synchronization. The application showcases concepts like locks, conditions, and thread management in a real-world-inspired scenario.
