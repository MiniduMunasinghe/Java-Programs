The Vehicle Factory System is a Java-based application that demonstrates the Factory Design Pattern for creating and managing various vehicle models, including cars and buses. It uses a hierarchical structure of interfaces (Vehicle, ICar, IBus) and concrete implementations like BMW and Benz to simulate a factory system. The application supports a singleton pattern for factories and vehicle instances, ensuring efficient resource usage and consistent object management. By using the VehicleProducer class, users can dynamically select a specific factory (e.g., CarFactory or BusFactory) and request models like BMW or Benz, showcasing a modular and extensible approach to object creation.
